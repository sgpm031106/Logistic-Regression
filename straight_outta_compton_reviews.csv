review
"What musicians would America have oppressed if Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, MC Ren, and DJ Yella listened to the naysayers and followed those who said rap music, sampling, reality rap, all of it, was a waste of time and definitely illegal?"
"It would be nicer to savor a smaller portion of chocolate ice cream and take your time appreciating the scent of the fudge swirls or the texture of the melted ice cream. That was a long, drawn-out metaphor for what this film could have been."
"The story is epic enough that audiences will experience the significant musical and social influence N.W.A. had on the larger community of hip-hop, and how that influence continues to shape contemporary artists."
"Take Straight Outta Compton for what it is - a sanitised and over-dramatised take on one of hip-hop's most significant groups...for the two and a half hours it rolls, however, Hollywood and Compton are just different names for exactly the same place."
"Through the evocative lens of cinematographer Matthew Libatique, Gray illustrates the vibrancy and pain of this moment and, for the most part, does not leave out the contradictions."
"Straight Outta Compton is an eminently watchable movie with a point of view. Or, one could say, with an attitude."
One of 2015's best adult-oriented dramas and one of the best musical biopics of recent years.
"If the film's aim was to show us how much of N.W.A's core essence still remain in the music industry and society today, then it achieves that."
There's enough here to satisfy the biggest fans and stir the interest of newcomers alike.
It does justice to N.W.A's biography in a very entertaining way. 
"Straight Outta Compton serves its subject well, and couldn't have come at a more relevant time."
"Even if you're not a fan of the N.W.A, you should be able to enjoy ""Straight Outta Compton""; what's more, the film may actually turn you into one. "
"If you're a fan of rap and hip hop, odds are you'll love Straight Outta Compton. If not, you'll still enjoy it with the great performances and excellent filmmaking on display."
"Straight Outta Compton is disciplined, professional filmmaking where the director has enough sense to know his subject matter is so epic that telling the story straight is enough to make it work."
"The powerful and record-breaking film was written by Andrea Berloff and Jonathan Herman, and is an absolute must-see!"
"What we get is a visually thrilling, musically electric rise of an important band, followed by a pillow-soft landing into trite clich√©."
"There is so much going on in the lyrical wordplay of the music, much deeper than the critics who tend to focus on its violent imagery suggests."
"A hugely impressive cast, supplemented by an engrossing depiction of California, give perfectly-nuanced performances to a story that feels as important now as ever."
Straight Outta Compton proves as infectiously entertaining as it is educational thanks to F. Gary Gray's richly textured direction and a thumping soundtrack that confirms rap as the protest music of its time.
"Gray and screenwriters Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff at times feel too handcuffed to the group's well-documented history, breaking up the rhythm of the story to check off a minor, well-documented detail of the journey."
